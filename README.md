# Entropia
Project of League of Legends Scripting Platform, Entropia.

I am publishing the entire Entropia project here for the purpose of learning. Entropia was a undetected private League of Legends scripting platform for the past several months. I've decided to cease the development for the reason of lack of time, and this is my legacy.

This repository covers everything required to start a SUCCESSFULL League of Legends hack.
